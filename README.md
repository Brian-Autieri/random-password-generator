# Random Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a random password generator so that users can have a unique password based on the criteria they selected. A random password will be generated once the user selects a password length between 8 and 128 characters and chooses which characters to include such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. This benefits the user by:

- Providing them a way to create a password that's hard to guess
- Creating a password that offers greater security with a wide range of characters and length
- Giving them the ability to choose which type of characters are included or left out in their password
